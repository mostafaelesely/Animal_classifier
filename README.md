### Small Animal Classifier

## Project Description
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of small animals (dogs, cats, turtles, zebras) scraped from Instagram. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.9638 on the training set, but the validation accuracy was lower at 0.4706 due to the limited number of images available for training and validation.

## Dataset
- **Training Set**: 78 images belonging to 4 classes.
- **Validation Set**: 17 images belonging to 4 classes.

## Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy**: 0.9638
- **Training Loss**: 0.1338
- **Validation Accuracy**: 0.4706
- **Validation Loss**: 2.8981
